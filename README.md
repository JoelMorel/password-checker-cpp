# password-checker-cpp
a simple password checker that verifies a user input password to its constraints

This is a very straight forward password checker just like you find on any website online when you register. 
It prompts you to enter a password and if it falls within the acceptable criteria, it will prompt you to confirm the password.
If at anytime it fails to meet the criteria or the user enters a different password, it will revert back to the start.
